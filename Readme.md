## One-Shot Prompting
One-shot prompting is a method of interacting with a language model where you provide one example or instruction along with your query to guide the model’s response. Unlike multi-shot prompting, which includes multiple examples of input–output pairs to teach the model a pattern, one-shot prompting uses just one example to set the context for how the model should answer. 

## Example
User: Translate this sentence into French:
       "I like programming."
Model: J'aime programmer.
