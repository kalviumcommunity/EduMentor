## Chain of Thought Prompting
Chain of thought prompting is the process of guiding an AI model to reason through problems step-by-step before producing a final answer. Instead of immediately giving a response, the AI first generates intermediate reasoning steps — similar to showing its “thought process” — which leads to more accurate, logical, and explainable conclusions.

This technique works by explicitly instructing the AI to think aloud (internally or visibly) so it can break down complex tasks into smaller steps. In many cases, the reasoning is hidden from the final user output, but it influences how the model arrives at its conclusion.

Unlike simple instruction prompting, which asks for a direct answer in one go, chain of thought prompting encourages structured reasoning that mimics human problem-solving.

## Why use it?
Improves accuracy for multi-step reasoning tasks

Helps the model handle logic, math, and complex decision trees

Reduces likelihood of skipping steps or making leaps in reasoning

Can make model’s decision process more explainable (when reasoning is shown) 

## Example 1 — Basic Reasoning Chain
Prompt:
"You have 3 apples, you buy 2 more, and then eat 1. How many apples are left? Show your reasoning."

AI (Chain of Thought):

Start with 3 apples.

Buy 2 more → total becomes 5 apples.

Eat 1 apple → total becomes 4 apples.
Answer: You have 4 apples left.

## Example 2 — Hidden Reasoning Steps
Prompt to AI:
"Reason step-by-step, then only show the final answer: 15×4 + 30 ÷ 5"

AI Internal Reasoning (hidden):

15×4 = 60

30 ÷ 5 = 6

60 + 6 = 66
Output to User: 66

## Example 3 — Complex Problem-Solving
Prompt:
"A train travels 60 km in 1.5 hours. Then it takes a 30-minute break, and continues for another 120 km in 2 hours. What is the average speed for the trip? Show your reasoning."

## AI Reasoning:

First leg speed: 60 km ÷ 1.5 h = 40 km/h

Second leg speed: 120 km ÷ 2 h = 60 km/h

Total distance = 60 + 120 = 180 km

Total travel time = 1.5 h + 0.5 h (break) + 2 h = 4 hours

Average speed = 180 km ÷ 4 h = 45 km/h
Answer: 45 km/h


Chain of Thought Prompting = Explicit instruction to think step-by-step → AI generates intermediate reasoning → Produces a final, more accurate answer
