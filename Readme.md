## What Is Structured Output?

Structured output in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to generating responses in a predefined, machine-readable format—such as JSON, XML, or key-value pairs—rather than plain, unstructured text. This approach ensures that the model’s output can be directly parsed and integrated into applications without requiring additional text processing or complex parsing logic.

From a technical perspective, structured output is achieved by guiding the LLM with explicit instructions and sometimes schema definitions, ensuring the generated data follows the expected structure. This is particularly important for tasks like API responses, database updates, data analysis pipelines, and automated workflows.

## Advantages of Structured Output:

Reliability → Guarantees predictable formatting for easy parsing.

Automation → Allows direct integration into systems without extra text processing.

Validation → Enables schema-based validation to ensure correctness. 

Example:
If you ask an LLM for weather data, instead of receiving a paragraph, you can get:

{
  "city": "Delhi",
  "temperature": 32,
  "unit": "Celsius",
  "condition": "Sunny"
}

This format is immediately usable by applications, dashboards, or APIs.

Low structure → Human-readable but inconsistent output, harder to process automatically.
High structure → Strictly machine-readable, perfect for programmatic consumption.
